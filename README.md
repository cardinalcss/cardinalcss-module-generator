## Credits

This fork is essentially a carbon copy of the awesome [postcss-plugin-boilerplate](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-plugin-boilerplate) project by [@ai](https://github.com/ai). Itâ€™s been slightly adapted to generate Cardinal CSS modules instead of PostCSS plugins.

Many thanks for your great work!
